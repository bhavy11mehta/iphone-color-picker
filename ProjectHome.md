iphone-color-picker is a free and open source color picker view for iOS. You are free to incorporate it into your own free or paid iOS apps. <a href='AppsUsingColorPicker.md'>Others already have</a>.<br>
<br>
If you download the project, or checkout the source, you will see a simple app consisting of a button that brings up the color picker view as a modal view. See the HowTo wiki page for more instructions on incorporating the code into your own project. Please consider contributing any improvements you make back to the project, and help us fill the UI hole left by Apple by not including a native color picker. And be sure to add your app to our list AppsUsingColorPicker!<br>
